* FreeBSD on Vagrant
** TODO Restore the pkg configuration to default
We are setting the pkg site to the wunki server. This should be restored to
default.
** TODO Don't show the boot menu
The boot menu takes ten seconds to show, that's just a waste of time in a
headless VM.
** TODO Cleanup pkg's after installation
Clean the package cache because it saves some space.
** TODO Destroy all history
Destroy all the shell history.
** TODO Minimize disk space
=dd= all the empty space and remove it again. This also saves space when
packaging the box.
** TODO Edit the MOTD (/etc/motd)
Add a pretty MOTD.
** TODO Document Virtualbox settings
Virtualbox needs some specific settings to boot a FreeBSD ISO. Add that
information to the README so people can start from scratch on their own.
